/**
 * Currently, Java provides no fine-grained control over the inheritance.
 * Access modifiers such as public, protected, private, as well as the default package-private, provide very coarse-grained control.
 * To that end, the goal of sealed classes is to allow individual classes to declare which types may be used as sub-types.
 * This also applies to interfaces and determining which types can implement them.
 * Sealed classes involve two new keywords :
 * - sealed
 * - permits
 * This finite and exhaustive hierarchy is one of the great benefits of using sealed classes
